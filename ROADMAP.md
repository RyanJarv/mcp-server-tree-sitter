# MCP Tree-sitter Server Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and future features for the MCP Tree-sitter Server project.

## Short-term Goals (0-3 months)

### Code Quality
- ✅ Fix linting issues identified by ruff
- ✅ Improve exception handling using proper `from` clause
- ✅ Remove unused variables and improve code organization
- [ ] Achieve 100% type hinting coverage
- [ ] Improve docstring coverage and quality

### Testing
- [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- [ ] Add integration tests for MCP server functionality
- [ ] Create automated testing workflow with GitHub Actions

### Documentation
- ✅ Create CONTRIBUTING.md with developer guidelines
- [ ] Improve README with more examples and clearer installation instructions
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create usage tutorials and examples

## Medium-term Goals (3-6 months)

### Feature Improvements
- [ ] Add support for more tree-sitter languages
- [ ] Improve query building tools with more sophisticated matching options
- [ ] Implement more advanced code analysis metrics
- [ ] Enhance caching system with better invalidation strategy

### User Experience
- [ ] Create a web-based UI for visualizing ASTs and running queries
- [ ] Add CLI commands for common operations
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for long-running operations
- [ ] Add configuration presets for different use cases

### Security
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Implement access control for multi-user environments
- [ ] Add sandbox mode for running untrusted queries

## Long-term Goals (6+ months)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement semantic analysis capabilities
- [ ] Add code transformation tools
- [ ] Support cross-language analysis
- [ ] Add machine learning-based code pattern recognition

### Integration
- [ ] Create plugins for popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- [ ] Implement integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Add support for other LLM frameworks beyond MCP

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize for large codebases (> 1M LOC)
- [ ] Implement distributed analysis for very large projects
- [ ] Add streaming responses for large result sets

## Feature Requests and Ideas

Below are some ideas and feature requests being considered:

1. **Semantic Diff**: Show semantic differences between code versions rather than just text diffs
2. **Code Quality Metrics**: Integrate with code quality metrics and linters
3. **Interactive Query Builder**: Visual tool to build and test tree-sitter queries
4. **Code Completion**: Use tree-sitter for more intelligent code completion suggestions
5. **Visualization Export**: Export AST visualizations to various formats (SVG, PNG, etc.)
